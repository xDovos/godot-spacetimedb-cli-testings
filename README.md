this is not an official [SpacetimeDB](https://github.com/ClockworkLabs/SpacetimeDB) repo.

to use this. download the repo and open it up with Godot. it is currently in the standard 4.4.1 version or higher.

this project is using the CMD to run CLI commands and requires you to have the SpacetimeDB CLI installed and that you are [logged in](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/cli-reference#spacetime-login). 
it is written for windows 10 and i can't tell if it will work on other OS.

this project is just for fun and likely will be never finished. you are free to fork it and make something better out of it.

it is likely that it never will support schema parsing and reducer calls with custom types.
